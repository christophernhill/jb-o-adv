# Interactive code in your book

Sometimes you'd rather let people interact with code *directly on the page*
instead of sending them off to a Binder or a JupyterHub. There are currently
a few ways to make this happen in Jupyter Book (both of which are experimental).

This page describes how to bring interactivity to your book. Both of these
tools use [**MyBinder**](https://mybinder.org) to provide a remote kernel.
